The difficulty of this problem arises from the fact that the video has been blurred by a known point spread function. In this case the use of video enhancement software is helpful. DEVIX is a video enhancer that can enhance a video automatically and can adjust some settings on the video like brightness, contrast and sharpness by the use of algorithms. The Deconvolution is an algorithm which is widely used in image processing and has the ability to generate a good quality output. Deblurring Algorithm or sharpening filter is also known as sharpness enhancement, sharpening is the opposite operation of blurring. A sharpening filter, also called a high-pass filter, emphasizes discontinuities in the pixel values by subtracting a contribution from the surrounding pixels from an increases central pixel. This means that when the surrounding pixels are dark, the central pixel is increased in brightness which enhances the edges of an image. With this video enhancer user can produce a good quality output. In addition, DEVIX video enhancer also have zoom in and zoom out button that will allow the user  to see the video more clearer.', NULL),
